/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Next step where companies determine the requirements an application needs to address and also dsignates each team's responsibilities.  "
const design= "Next step where the team focuses on the architecture and defining the product's programming language.The product is being designed and ready for the next phase."
const implementation= "The stage where the product is actually built using coding. Features from the design phase are being coded to create the product."
